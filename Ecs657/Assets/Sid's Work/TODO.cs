    /*Just to refresh, hotbar is going funky, and the spell doesn't cast
     * and spellstack is fucked too
     * However, icon and sprite work fine now, because it required UI, not UIElements for the import
     * Now hotbar's been refactored to instantiate the slots in grid, and make slots fully private
     * Next, refactor spellstack to instantiate its own slots. too
     * 
     * After that, refactor both to search for spell list and take the actual spell list from it
     * Check that fire works after, and it's smooth sailing from there with the new spells
